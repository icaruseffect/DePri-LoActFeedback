Home 4. Location & Activity based Feedback

# Description

Data about energy are often not interpretable by the user. Energy is a by-­‐product of every days activities.  
Therefore, the user needs to see the data in the right context. Location based feedback uses the position of the  
user to show the energy consumption e.g. within his immediate range or to assign the energy consumption to the  
right person.  

## User Goals
 
- Where is energy used?  
- Where is energy possibly wasted?  
- Where is energy used within my range?  

## Needs to be satisfied

- Information need (answering specific question)
- Control need (minimizing uncertainness)
- Curiosity & Entertainment (“What is going on in my home”)
- Information about overall home consumption and of individual devices
- Room position of the person(s) in the households
